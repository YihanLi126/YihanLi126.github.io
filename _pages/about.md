I'm a [Robotics MSE student](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/yihan-li/) at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/). I'm also one of the [2025 Robotics Student Fellows](https://robotx.ethz.ch/education/robotics-student-fellowship/2025-robotics-student-fellows.html) in [ETH Robotics Student Fellowship](https://robotx.ethz.ch/education/robotics-student-fellowship.html), working at [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8yNDQxLC0xNDI1MTk1NzM1.html).

Prior to this, I received my bachelor’s degree in Automation Engineering Major and EE & Automation Engineering Minor from [Qian Xuesen Honors College](https://bjb.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm#), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). During my undergrad, I also worked as a visiting student at [Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/). 

My research interest lies in robot learning and control in pHRI(Physical Human–Robot Interaction) scenarios, currently with a particular emphasis on whole-body manipulation. I aim to develop **adaptive, efficient, and safe** robotic systems that **robustly interact with dynamic physical environments** and **support smooth human–robot collaboration**, which could be integrated into people’s daily lives to provide assistance and care. I’m actively seeking for opening PhD positions in 2026Fall.

<!-- My research focuses on enabling robots to learn robust motion policies with minimal human effort, leveraging multimodal sensing to enhance interactivity and strengthen safety guarantees. I strive to make incremental contributions toward a future in which robots are integrated into people’s daily lives to provide assistance and care. -->
